This is a Html & Css based exercise from The Odin Project. 

Project Title: Photographer Landing Page

Motivation: This landing page is a means to test what I've leared in the last month in regards to CSS and HTML. The direct inspiration for photography as a subject is due to my history as a photographer. 

Exercise: This project is where I'll be creating an entire web page from a design provided for me by TOP. The point of tthis assignment is to create something form scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It also doesn't necessarily matter if I use margin: 24px when a design actually has margin: 48px in the example image provided. I'm also free to substitue my own content into this design. Using my own images instead of dummy images found on image hosting sites.
